### 문제 설명

<p>Gahui is watching the annual character election. After the election, <strong>The top 16 characters</strong> receive enormous benefits for one year because they belong to the Tier 1 (ranked 1st - 16th) section. For that reason, fans vote passionately to get their favorite characters into the top 16. Remarkably, at least one Cinderella appears in every election, achieving an outstanding outcome.</p>

<p>The competition rate of election is defined as the number of characters that satisfy the conditions below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The character <strong>does not belong to the Tier 1</strong> section.</li>
	<li>The difference in votes between the character and the 16th-ranked character is<strong> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML" style="font-size: 99.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c></mjx-mn><mjx-mstyle><mjx-mspace style="width: 0.167em;"></mjx-mspace></mjx-mstyle><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c30"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c30"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c30"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1</mn><mstyle scriptlevel="0"><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace></mstyle><mn>000</mn></math></mjx-assistive-mml><span aria-hidden="true" class="no-mathjax mjx-copytext">$1\,000$</span></mjx-container> or less.</strong></li>
