### 문제 설명

<p>In order to send a secret message to your friend, you invent an original method to encrypt the message. The encryption rule is quite simple. A letter is replaced with 2-digit number. Each letter has its corresponding number as the following:</p>

<pre>a = 01, b = 02, c = 03, ..., y = 25, z = 26
A = 27, B = 28, C = 29, ..., Y = 51, Z = 52</pre>

<p>Every numeric character (0-9) that appears in the original message will be prefixed by #. All other characters will not be changed.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input message is composed of a string containing less than 128 characters.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print out the encrypted message.</p>
