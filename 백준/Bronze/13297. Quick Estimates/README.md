### 문제 설명

<p>Let’s face it... you are not that handy. When you need to make a major home repair, you often need to hire someone to help. When they come for the first visit, they make an estimate of the cost. Here they must be careful: if they overestimate the cost, it might scare you off, but if they underestimate, the work might not be worth their time.</p>

<p>Because the worker is so careful, it can take a long time for them to produce the estimate. But that’s frustrating — when you ask for an estimate, you really are asking for the magnitude of the cost. Will this be <span>$</span>10 or <span>$</span>100 or <span>$</span>1 000? That’s all you really want to know on a first visit.</p>

<p>Please help the worker make the type of estimate you desire. Write a program that, given the worker’s estimate, reports just the magnitude of the cost — the number of digits needed to represent the estimate.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input begins with a line containing an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). The next N lines each contain one estimated cost, which is an integer between 0 and 10<sup>100</sup>. (Some of the workmen overcharge quite a bit.)</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each estimated cost, output the number of digits required to represent it.</p>
