### 문제 설명

<p>The coach of Jacqueline Yo, Olympic swimmer for Singapore, is concerned about her Butterfly stroke. He records her daily timing in milliseconds (a millisecond is onethousand of a second) and devises a scheme whereby each time she achieves a timing that is lower than the previous day’s timing by at least a certain number of milliseconds, he will reward her with a small encouragement gift.</p>

<p>Given a list of daily timings, determine how many gifts Jacqueline would have received.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains 2 integers n and k, where n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) is the number of days, and k (0 < k ≤ 100,000) the desired improvement (in milliseconds). Whenever Jacqueline’s timing reduces by at least k milliseconds over the previous day’s timing, she will receive a gift from her coach. The first line is then followed by n lines where each line contains a single integer t (0 < t ≤ 100,000) which is Jacqueline’s daily timing in milliseconds. The n timing records are listed in chronological order.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output consists of a single integer that indicates the number of gifts Jacqueline would have received.</p>
