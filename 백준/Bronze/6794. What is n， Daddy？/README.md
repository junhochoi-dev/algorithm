### 문제 설명

<p>Natalie is learning to count on her fingers. When her Daddy tells her a number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), she asks “What is n, Daddy?”, by which she means “How many fingers should I hold up on each hand so that the total is n?”</p>

<p>To make matters simple, her Daddy gives her the correct finger representation according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the number may be represented on one or two hands;</li>
	<li>if the number is represented on two hands, the larger number is given first.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if Natalie asks “What is 4, Daddy?”, her Dad may reply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 is 4.</li>
	<li>4 is 3 and 1.</li>
	<li>4 is 2 and 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your job is to make sure that Natalie’s Daddy gives the correct number of answers.</p>

### 입력

### 출력
