### 문제 설명

<p>A known problem with some microphones is the “hissing s”. That is, sometimes the sound of the letter s is particularly pronounced; it stands out from the rest of the word in an unpleasant way.</p>

<p>Of particular annoyance are words that contain the letter s twice in a row. Words like <code>amiss</code>, <code>kiss</code>, <code>mississippi</code> and even <code>hiss</code> itself.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains a single string on a single line. This string consists of only lowercase letters (no spaces) and has between 1 and 30 characters.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single line. If the input string contains two consecutive occurrences of the letter s, then output <code>hiss</code>. Otherwise, output <code>no hiss</code>.</p>
