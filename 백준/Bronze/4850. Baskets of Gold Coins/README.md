### 문제 설명

<p>You are given N baskets of gold coins. The baskets are numbered from 1 to N. In all except one of the baskets, each gold coin weighs w grams. In the one exceptional basket, each gold coin weighs w−d grams. A wizard appears on the scene and takes 1 coin from Basket 1, 2 coins from Basket 2, and so on, up to and including N−1 coins from Basket N−1. He does not take any coins from Basket N. He weighs the selected coins and concludes which of the N baskets contains the lighter coins. Your mission is to emulate the wizard's computation.</p>

The fourth integer is the result of weighing the selected coins.</p>

<p>N will be at least 2 and not more than 8000. The value of w will be at most 30. The value of d will be less than w.</p>
