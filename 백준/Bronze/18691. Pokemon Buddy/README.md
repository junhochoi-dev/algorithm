### 문제 설명

<p>Pokemon Go just released the Buddy update. It lets you select a Pokemon to appear alongside your trainer’s avatar on your profile screen. As you walk with your buddy, it will find candy that can be used to evolve the Pokemon.</p>

<p>The Buddy system divides the Pokemons into 3 groups. Each group gives one candy upon walking for 1, 3, and 5 kilometers respectively</p>

<p>In this problem you will be given the Pokemon group G, the number of candies C you initially have, and the number of candies E required to evolve the Pokemon. You should calculate the number of Kilometers required to walk in order to evolve the Pokemon.</p>

### 입력

<p>Each test case consists of a line containing three space separated integers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>G: The group of the Pokemon (1 ≤ G ≤ 3)</li>
	<li>C: The initial candies you have (0 ≤ C ≤ 100)</li>
	<li>E: The candies required to evolve the Pokemon (1 ≤ E ≤ 100)</li>
</ul>
