### 문제 설명

<p>Angela is teaching her primary school pupils how to use a protractor (which hopefully you know is a device used to measure angles!). She has given each pupil a set of triangles and asked them to measure and record each of the three internal angles.</p>

<p>Angela would like you to write a simple program to check her pupil s results. Knowing that the internal angles of a triangle add up to 180º, which results should Angela check?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>You will be given a set of results from one class. It will start with a single integer, N, the number of pupils who have supplied readings. (0 < N <= 30). There will then follow N lines, each containing 3 positive integers separated by spaces. The numbers represent the measurements supplied by a pupil for the 3 angles of a triangle.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each set of readings, output the numbers as input followed by the word Check if they do not add up to 180, or Seems OK if they do.</p>
