### 문제 설명

<p>Your friend, Greedy George, visits a candy store for his snacks for the school excursion, grabbing 300 yen in his hand. In the candy store, one item of each different kind of snack is placed in a line on the shelf. After entering the store, Greedy George picks up a shopping basket and starts checking the snacks on the shelf from left to right. If the sum of the prices of snacks in the basket will not exceed 300 yen, he immediately puts the checked snack into the basket. If the sum should exceed 300 yen, he tearfully skips that snack. After examining all the snacks in this manner to the right end, George heads to the checkout.</p>

<p>Given a list of the prices of the snacks in the store, compute how much money Greedy George will spend.</p>
