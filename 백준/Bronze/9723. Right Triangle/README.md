### 문제 설명

<p>A right triangle or right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a<br>
right angle (that is, at 90 degrees angle). The largest side of such a triangle is called hypotenuse. The relation between the sides of the triangle is</p>

<p>c<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>, Where c is the hypotenuse</p>

<p>Given 3 sides of a triangle, your task is to determine whether the given triangle is a right triangle or not. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line has a positive integer T, T <= 100000, denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by each test case per line. </p>

<p>Each test case consists of a line containing 3 integers a,b and c denoting the sides of a triangle. All of these sides will be between 1 and 100, inclusive. The sides a,b and c can be given in any order. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, the output contains a line in the format Case #x: M, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and M is “YES” when the given triangle is a right triangle or “NO” otherwise. Note that the quotes are not required to be outputted. </p>
