### 문제 설명

<p>The Taiwan Online Programming Contest is a prestigious event that attracts talented programmers from all over the world. Known for its challenging problems and competitive environment, the contest has become a platform where only the best can prove their skills. However, there is one problem setter who has gained a notorious reputation among participants. This problem setter, known only by their pseudonym “<code>truckski</code>,” has an unusual fascination with numbers – particularly big numbers, floating-point numbers, and any kind of mathematical challenge that involves precise calculations. <code>truckski</code> has a unique style of creating problems that often requires competitors to think carefully about the properties of numbers and how they can be manipulated.</p>

<p>In this year’s edition of the Taiwan Online Programming Contest, <code>truckski</code> has come up with a seemingly simple yet tricky problem. The problem revolves around a fundamental concept in mathematics: rounding down a floating-point number to its nearest integer. While this task might appear straightforward at first glance, <code>truckski</code>’s twist lies in the precision required and the ability to handle a variety of foating-point values accurately.</p>

<p>Your task is to help the participants solve this problem by writing a program that takes a positive foating-point number as input and outputs the result of rounding it down to the nearest integer. This process is often referred to as taking the “floor” of a number. The floor of a number is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to the number itself.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line containing one positive floating-point number <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML" style="font-size: 99.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D465 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>x</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml><span aria-hidden="true" class="no-mathjax mjx-copytext">$x$</span></mjx-container>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should be a single integer, which is the floor of the input number <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML" style="font-size: 99.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D465 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>x</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml><span aria-hidden="true" class="no-mathjax mjx-copytext">$x$</span></mjx-container>. Please do not output decimal points.</p>
